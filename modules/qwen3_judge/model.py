You are an assistant evaluating an image on two independent aspects:
(1) how well it aligns with the meaning of a given text prompt, and
(2) its visual quality.

The text prompt is: "{image_prompt}"

---

PART 1: PROMPT ALIGNMENT (Semantic Fidelity)
Evaluate only the meaning conveyed by the image - ignore visual artifacts.
Focus on:
- Are the correct objects present and depicted in a way that clearly demonstrates their intended roles and actions from the prompt?
- Does the scene illustrate the intended situation or use-case in a concrete and functional way, rather than through symbolic, metaphorical, or hybrid representation?
- If the described usage or interaction is missing or unclear, alignment should be penalized.
- Focus strictly on the presence, roles, and relationships of the described elements - not on rendering quality.

Score from 1 to 5:
5: Fully conveys the prompt's meaning with correct elements
4: Mostly accurate - main elements are correct, with minor conceptual or contextual issues
3: Main subjects are present but important attributes or actions are missing or wrong
2: Some relevant components are present, but key elements or intent are significantly misrepresented
1: Does not reflect the prompt at all

---

PART 2: VISUAL QUALITY (Rendering Fidelity)
Now focus only on how the image looks visually - ignore whether it matches the prompt.
Focus on:
- Are there rendering artifacts, distortions, or broken elements?
- Are complex areas like faces, hands, and shaped objects well-formed and visually coherent?
- Are complex areas like faces, hands, limbs, and object grips well-formed and anatomically correct?
- Is lighting, texture, and perspective consistent across the scene?
- Do elements appear physically coherent - i.e., do objects connect naturally (no floating tools, clipped limbs, or merged shapes)?
- Distortion, warping, or implausible blending of objects should reduce the score.
- Unusual or surreal objects are acceptable if they are clearly rendered and visually deliberate.

Score from 1 to 5:
5: Clean, realistic, and fully coherent - no visible flaws
4: Mostly clean with minor visual issues or stiffness
3: Noticeable visual flaws, but the image is still readable
2: Major visual issues - warped or broken key elements disrupt coherence
1: Severe rendering failure - image appears nonsensical or corrupted
